title: Twitter clone
slug: twitter
video: '/assets/twitter-video.mp4'
about: a full stack Twitter-like app built using t3 stack, which is now fully operational and includes nearly all necessary features. The primary goal behind creating this imitation is to discover the capabilities of the t3 stack and its potential. Took me around 2 months to finish this project, keep in mind there's probably gonna be upcoming features coming too, because I'm not done with this yet.
stacks: [tRPC, Typescript,React, Next js, Supabase,Prisma, Tailwind css]
