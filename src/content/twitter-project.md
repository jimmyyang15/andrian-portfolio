title: Twitter clone
slug: twitter
video: '/assets/twitter-video.mp4'
about:  a fully functional application similar to Twitter, built using the t3 stack, which includes nearly all essential features. The main objective behind building this replica was to explore the capabilities and potential of the t3 stack. This project was a major undertaking for me, and it took me almost three months to complete.
